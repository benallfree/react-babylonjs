import Fooz from './HelloReact'

<Fooz />
<Fooz />

If you already know how to create a React project, you can skip this section.
Otherwise, let's go!z

```bash
npx create-react-app my-app
```

or with yarn:

```bash
yarn create react-app my-app
```

Once you have a project, you'll find a setup that looks a little like this:

[demo:HelloReact.tsx]
