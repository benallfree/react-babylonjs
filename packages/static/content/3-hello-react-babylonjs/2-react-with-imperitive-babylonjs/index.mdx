Once you have a React project set up, you can program Babylon.js imperitively
just like they tell you in the
[official Babylon.js + React guide](https://doc.babylonjs.com/extensions/Babylon.js+ExternalLibraries/BabylonJS_and_ReactJS).

Wow, it takes **almost 150 lines of code** to make a box show up on a screen!
But do not be scared. We are showing you how much coding it actually takes so
you'll fully appreciate the next section.

[demo:FullImperitive.tsx]

Now to be completely fair, Babylon.js has created a helpful
[babylonjs-hook](https://www.npmjs.com/package/babylonjs-hook) package which
replaces `SceneComponent`. If you use this, you can get down to about **60 lines
of code**. But next, I'll show you how to do it in **under 30**.

[demo:WithHooks.tsx]
