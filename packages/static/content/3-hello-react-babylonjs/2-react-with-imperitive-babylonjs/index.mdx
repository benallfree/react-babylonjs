Once you have a React project set up, you can program Babylon.js imperitively
just like they tell you in the
[official Babylon.js + React guide](https://doc.babylonjs.com/extensions/Babylon.js+ExternalLibraries/BabylonJS_and_ReactJS).

[demo:FullImperitive.tsx]

The demo above is produced using imperitive Typescript shown below. Wow, it
takes \**almost 150 lines of code*to make a box show up on a screen! But do not
be scared. We are showing you how much work it actually takes so you'll fully
appreciate the power of `react-babylonjs`.

As you review the code, notice everything happens in sequence and you are
responsible for re-running affected code when you change the input values.

In a [reactive programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reactive_programming),
a change in the input values naturally cascades to affected code. There are many
benefits to a reactive programming style that we won't cover here. But speed,
efficiency, and ability to reason through complex state changes are among the
many benefits.

Mixing imperitive programming with React is generally an antipattern because it
reduces the benefits of reactive programming.

Therefore, this code is the least desirable way to use Babylon.js in React.

[code:FullImperitive.tsx]

Now to be completely fair, Babylon.js has created a helpful
[babylonjs-hook](https://www.npmjs.com/package/babylonjs-hook) package which
replaces `SceneComponent`. If you use this, you can get down to about **60 lines
of code**. But it's still imperitive programming, not declarative or reactive
programming.

After this, I'll show you how to do the same thing in **under 50 lines of code
using real declarative programming**.
