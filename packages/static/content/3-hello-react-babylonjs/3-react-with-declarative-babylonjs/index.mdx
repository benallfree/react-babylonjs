In previous sections, we saw how to:

- Create a boilerplate React app
- Instantiate a Babylon.js scene imperitively
- Shoehorn the above into React in about 150 lines of code, still not "reactive"
  or declarative
- Reduce 150 lines of code to 60 by moving some of it into a 3rd party package,
  but still not reactive or declarative

But now, we'll see how to do the exact same thing in **just under 50 lines of
code using a true reactive/declarative approach**.

We also learn how to make custom Babylon React components, and how to use some
helpful hooks like `useScene`, `useBeforeRender`.
