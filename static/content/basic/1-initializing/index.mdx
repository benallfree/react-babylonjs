title: 'Initializing Babylon.js'
---

import { Engine, Scene } from 'react-babylonjs'
import { Color3, Vector3 } from '@babylonjs/core'

You can program Babylon.js declaratively just like any React application.

# Step 1: Create a basic React skeleton

You probably recognize this as a boilerplate `index.tsx` in React:

```typescript
import { FC } from 'react'
import { render } from 'react-dom'

const App: FC = () => (
  <div style={{ flex: 1, display: 'flex' }}>Hello, React!</div>
)

const rootElement = document.getElementById('root')
render(<App />, rootElement)
```

The result looks like:

[demo:1.tsx]

# Step 2: Add Babylon.js `<Engine>` and `<Scene>`

So far, so good. Boilerplate React. Now let's begin to add some magic to
`App.tsx` by replacing the `Hello React!` with Babylon.js bootstrapping.

### The _old_ way

Normally, you would need to initialize a Babylon.js
[Engine](https://doc.babylonjs.com/typedoc/classes/babylon.engine) and
[Scene](https://doc.babylonjs.com/start/chap1/first_scene#say-hello-to-your-first-world)
along with a camera, light, and object to view.

```typescript
// The old way. We dislike it.

import * as BABYLON from '@babylonjs/core'

var canvas = document.getElementById('renderCanvas')
const engine = new BABYLON.Engine(canvas, true, {
  preserveDrawingBuffer: true,
  stencil: true,
  disableWebGL2Support: false,
})
const scene = new BABYLON.Scene(engine)
const camera = new BABYLON.ArcRotateCamera(
  'camera',
  -Math.PI / 2,
  Math.PI / 2.5,
  3,
  new BABYLON.Vector3(0, 0, 0),
  scene
)
camera.attachControl(canvas, true)
const light = new BABYLON.HemisphericLight(
  'light',
  new BABYLON.Vector3(0, 1, 0),
  scene
)
const box = BABYLON.MeshBuilder.CreateBox('box', {}, scene)
```

### The _new_ way

The above is a lot of imperitive programming. If we've learned anything over the
last few years, we've learned that the benefits of declarative programming are
clear and numerous for large applications. So, we can do this instead:

[demo:2.tsx]

### Step 3: Try it yourself
