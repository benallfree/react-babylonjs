title: 'Initializing Babylon.js'

import { Engine, Scene } from 'react-babylonjs'
import { Color3, Vector3 } from '@babylonjs/core'

You can program Babylon.js declaratively just like any React application.

# Plain old React - life before Babylon.js

We assume you know how to create a new, plain old React app. But for everyone
else, it looks like this:

```bash
npx create-react-app my-app
```

or with yarn:

```bash
yarn create react-app my-app
```

Once you have a project, you'll find a setup that looks a little like this:

```typescript
// index.tsx

import { render } from 'react-dom'
import App from './App'

const rootElement = document.getElementById('root')
render(<App />, rootElement)
```

and

```typescript
// App.tsx

import { FC } from 'react'

const App: FC = () => (
  <div style={{ flex: 1, display: 'flex' }}>Hello, React!</div>
)

export default App
```

Running it will produce:

[demo:HelloWorldComponent.tsx]

# Plain old React - life after Babylon.js

Now that we have a boilerplate React project, we can follow the
[official Babylon.js + React guide](https://doc.babylonjs.com/extensions/Babylon.js+ExternalLibraries/BabylonJS_and_ReactJS),
by doing something like:

[code:SceneComponent.tsx]

Then, we need to make a page that uses it:

[code:PageUsingSceneComponent.tsx]

Running the above, code, you'll see:

[demo:PageUsingSceneComponent.tsx]

Alternatively, you can use

[babylonjs-hook](https://www.npmjs.com/package/babylonjs-hook) as follows:

And you'll get the same thing:

# Step 2: Add Babylon.js `<Engine>` and `<Scene>`

So far, so good. Boilerplate React. Now let's begin to add some magic to
`App.tsx` by replacing the `Hello React!` with Babylon.js bootstrapping.

### The _old_ way

Normally, you would need to initialize a Babylon.js
[Engine](https://doc.babylonjs.com/typedoc/classes/babylon.engine) and
[Scene](https://doc.babylonjs.com/start/chap1/first_scene#say-hello-to-your-first-world)
along with a camera, light, and object to view.

```typescript
// The old way. We dislike it.

import * as BABYLON from '@babylonjs/core'

var canvas = document.getElementById('renderCanvas')
const engine = new BABYLON.Engine(canvas, true, {
  preserveDrawingBuffer: true,
  stencil: true,
  disableWebGL2Support: false,
})
const scene = new BABYLON.Scene(engine)
const camera = new BABYLON.ArcRotateCamera(
  'camera',
  -Math.PI / 2,
  Math.PI / 2.5,
  3,
  new BABYLON.Vector3(0, 0, 0),
  scene
)
camera.attachControl(canvas, true)
const light = new BABYLON.HemisphericLight(
  'light',
  new BABYLON.Vector3(0, 1, 0),
  scene
)
const box = BABYLON.MeshBuilder.CreateBox('box', {}, scene)
```

### The _new_ way

The above is a lot of imperitive programming. If we've learned anything over the
last few years, we've learned that the benefits of declarative programming are
clear and numerous for large applications. So, we can do this instead:

[demo:FullReactComponent.tsx]

### Step 3: Try it yourself
